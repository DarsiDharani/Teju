# CORS Error Fix - Performance Feedback Endpoint

## Understanding the Error

The error you're seeing has two parts:

1. **CORS Error**: `Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8000/shared-content/manager/performance-feedback' from origin 'http://localhost:4200' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present`

2. **500 Internal Server Error**: The backend is returning a 500 error, which means something is failing on the server side.

## Root Cause

When FastAPI returns a 500 error (or any error), the CORS middleware might not always add CORS headers to the error response. This causes the browser to block the response, making it appear as a CORS error when the real issue is the 500 error.

## Solution Implemented

I've added three exception handlers in `backend/main.py` that ensure CORS headers are **always** present in error responses:

1. **HTTPException Handler**: Handles HTTP exceptions (400, 403, 404, etc.) with CORS headers
2. **RequestValidationError Handler**: Handles validation errors with CORS headers  
3. **Global Exception Handler**: Catches all other unhandled exceptions and adds CORS headers

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Restart Your Backend Server

**IMPORTANT**: The changes won't take effect until you restart your backend server.

1. Stop your current backend server (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)
2. Start it again:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python main.py
   # or
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

### Step 2: Test the Request Again

After restarting, try submitting the performance feedback again. You should now see:
- ✅ **No more CORS error** - The error response will have proper CORS headers
- ✅ **Actual error message** - You'll see the real error that's causing the 500, which will help us fix the underlying issue

### Step 3: Check Backend Logs

When you try the request again, check your backend server logs. You should see detailed error messages like:

```
ERROR - Unhandled exception: [actual error message]
ERROR - Traceback: [full stack trace]
```

This will tell us what's actually failing in the code.

## Common Causes of 500 Errors

The 500 error could be caused by:

1. **Database connection issues**
2. **Missing data** (e.g., training not found, manager-employee relationship missing)
3. **Null/None values** where they're not expected
4. **Import errors** (e.g., missing notification_service module)
5. **Database constraint violations**

## Next Steps

Once you restart the server and try again:

1. **If CORS error is gone but 500 persists**: Check the backend logs for the actual error message and share it so we can fix the root cause.

2. **If both errors persist**: Make sure the server restarted successfully and the changes were saved.

3. **If it works**: Great! The fix is working.

## Files Modified

- `backend/main.py`: Added exception handlers for CORS headers
- `backend/app/routes/shared_content_routes.py`: Added better error handling in the route

## Testing

To verify the fix is working:

1. Restart backend server
2. Open browser DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Network tab
4. Try submitting performance feedback
5. Check the response headers - you should see `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:4200`
6. Check the response body - you should see a proper error message instead of a CORS error
