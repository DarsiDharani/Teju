## Implementation Details

### Error Handling
All notification implementations include proper error handling:
- Notifications are created in try-except blocks
- Failures are logged but don't break the main operation
- Each notification is independent - if one fails, others still work

### Bulk Notifications
For cases 5 and 6 (assignments and feedback), notifications are sent to **all employees assigned to the training**:
- Queries `TrainingAssignment` table to get all assigned employees
- Loops through each employee and sends individual notification
- Each notification failure is handled independently

### Notification Service Functions
All functions are defined in `backend/app/notification_service.py`:
- `notify_training_assigned()`
- `notify_training_request_received()`
- `notify_training_request_approved()`
- `notify_training_request_rejected()`
- `notify_new_assignment_available()`
- `notify_new_feedback_available()`
- `notify_performance_feedback_received()`

## Testing Checklist

To verify all notifications are working:

1. ✅ **Training Assignment**: Assign a training to an employee → Employee receives notification
2. ✅ **Training Request**: Employee requests training → Manager receives notification
3. ✅ **Request Approval**: Manager approves request → Employee receives success notification
4. ✅ **Request Rejection**: Manager rejects request → Employee receives warning notification
5. ✅ **New Assignment**: Trainer shares assignment → All assigned employees receive notification
6. ✅ **New Feedback**: Trainer shares feedback form → All assigned employees receive notification
7. ✅ **Performance Feedback**: Manager provides feedback → Employee receives notification
